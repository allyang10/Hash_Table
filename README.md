All credit goes to James Routley's tutorial (https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table). I used his tutorial to teach myself about Hash Tables. I also made use of
MQQM's take on the tutorial (https://github.com/MQQM/write-a-hash-table/tree/master) which included some fixes and more explanations.
